# Project Overview

 - creating a hypothesis,
 - setting up the model,
 - measuring error.

Project use data from historical Olympic games. I trained to predict how many medals a country will win based on historical and current data.

# Project Steps

1. Form a hypothesis,
2. Find and explore the data,
3. Reshape the data to predict your target,
4. Clean the data for ML,
5. Pick an error metric,
6. Split your data,
7. Train a model.
